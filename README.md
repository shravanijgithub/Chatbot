# Chatbot

The chatbot was able to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to the input questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Seq2Seq LSTM model in conversational AI tasks.
This project aims to create a conversational chatbot using Sequence-to-Sequence Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Sequence-to-sequence learning involves training models to convert sequences from one domain to sequences in another domain. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.
